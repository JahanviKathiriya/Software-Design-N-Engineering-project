# Software-Design-N-Engineering-project
 This is my project for CS 200 to showcase what we've learned about software design and engineering

ChocAn.pdf lists all the required info for the software to be made.

CS 200: Course Description:
Introduction to software engineering: the software crisis, program life cycle, software systems analysis techniques, software modeling, theory and practice of design, program testing methodologies, programmer team organization, and program verification and synthesis. 
Outline of Topics:
